Congratulations! If you are watching this video

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:11,210
it means that you want to learn Go,  the language developed at Google to solve Google size problems.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:20,570
So what is Go good for? Go is good for Web services at scale, networking, massively concurrent applications,

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:29,870
operating systems, automation, and command-line tools or cryptography. Go is by design, expressive, comprehensible,

5
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,010
sophisticated, yet clean, clear and easy to read.

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,430
Go is on a trajectory to become the next enterprise programming language.

7
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:48,350
In a nutshell, Go provides you high performers like C and C++, super efficient, concurrency friendly

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,340
like a Java, but also fun to code like Python.

9
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:00,680
Cutting edge technologies and software are already written in Go, for example, Docker, Kubernetes

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,940
or Ethereum.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:13,100
In addition to Google, which uses Go widely in production, Go is used by Uber, Netflix, Pinterest,

12
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:23,300
Slack, SoundCloud and so many more. Go is based on real-world experience and its focus is on a larger

13
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,870
scale engineering. The language has amazing credentials.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,390
Google hired experienced software industry veterans like Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, who played a

15
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:44,670
major role in the invention of Unix, C, and parts of Unicode encoding scheme many decades ago.

16
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:53,210
Another Go contributor was Robert Griesemer, who studied under the creator of Pascals and has decades

17
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:57,120
of experience around compilers and garbage collection

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,450
after working on virtual machines for JavaScript in Java. According to the Stack Overflow Survey for

19
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:14,870
2020 Go is the second paying technology in the United States. Learning Go language programming could be

20
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,160
the best decision of your career.

21
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,220
So what are you waiting for?

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,360
Start your Go journey today and you'll never regret it!
